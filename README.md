 OIT Group Project: Civic & Human-Centered Analysis 
 
 This project was completed as a group classroom assignment at Oregon Institute of Technology(OIT) and focuses on homelessness & gaps in services in Portland, Oregon, a complex ongoing civic and public-health challenge. Due to limited data collection, our group focused on early-stage discovery with Human-centered design, accessibility and collaborative problem-solving. We had regular team communication via virtual Discord video call. Our goal for further researching this problem space is to bring awareness that even more changes are needed in policy, equity, and real people. This project's future goals as an open source is to center the lived experiences of affected homeless populations, identify additional gaps in services and accessibility, communicate findings clearly to a non-technical audience, and practice collborative delivery within a multidisciplinary team.
