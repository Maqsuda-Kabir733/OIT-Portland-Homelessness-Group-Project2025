 OIT Group Project: Civic & Human-Centered Analysis 
 
 This project was completed as a group classroom assignment at Oregon Institute of Technology(OIT) and focuses on homelessness & gaps in services in Portland, Oregon, a complex ongoing civic and public-health challenge. This project reflects my interest in: human-centered problem solving, civic technology and social impact, accessibility -first thinking and using technology to support vulerable populations. Our objectives: analyze avaiable datasets and public resources, highlight challenges faced by vulnerable populations, explore community-based and systemic solutions, accessibility and collaborative problem-solving and present findings in a clear format. Our Team used collaborative research and analysis, presentation and storytelling images, dataset interpretation from public sources and Team-based project planning and delivery. This was a Group Project completed collaborately. My personal contributions as a Creative Lead included: Research and analysis of limited datasets, content development, synthesis of findings and final Group Zoom presentation with appropriate visual images for awareness and request for support.
