 OIT Group Project: Civic & Human-Centered Analysis 
 
 This project was completed as a group classroom assignment at Oregon Institute of Technology(OIT) and focused on homelessness & gaps in services in Portland, Oregon, a complex ongoing civic and public-health challenge. This project reflects my interest in: human-centered problem solving, civic technology and social impact, accessibility-first thinking and using technology to support vulerable populations. Our objectives: analyze avaiable datasets and public resources, highlight challenges faced by vulnerable populations, explore community-based and systemic solutions, accessibility, collaborative problem-solving and present findings in a clear format. A few of the team members learned to use QGIS APP interactive map to analyze our collected datasets about homelessness and available services in certain neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon. By analyzing these spatial data layers in QGIS, we identified patterns and gaps in service coverage. This helped us to understand which area lack adequate resourcess. My personal contributions as a Creative Lead included: collection of datasets, synthesis of findings, content development,and final Group Zoom presentation. 

 Homeless in Portland is a complex issue that affects the entire community. Meaningful progress can only be made when everyone-public agencies, non-profit organizations, and residents-take part in supporting solutions that address both immediate needs and long term stability.
